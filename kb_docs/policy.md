# Return & Refund Policy

**Returns**

Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase was delivered, unfortunately, we canâ€™t offer you a refund or exchange.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.

Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.

**Refunds (if applicable)**

Once your return is received and inspected, we will email you to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

**Exchanges (if applicable)**

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, email us at support@example-store.com and send your item to: [Store Address].
